It's a series (currently only one) of Portlets for the [Atlassian JIRA®](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) Bug Tracking software.

A portlet is like a widget that resides in your JIRA® dashboard giving you some kind of information about the bugs.

The main portlet developed is an extension to the built-in "Show Saved Filter" with the option to add user selected fields to the list.
